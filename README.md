Here represented the easiest algorithm of alpha-blending. \
In first version I implemented it with loop and usual operations.\
(You can read about algorithm here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing \
or google is always glad to see you).\
\
Then I wanted to accelerate it. \
So I used Intrinsics, these are asm functions (all of them you can see at \
https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/#) \

P.S. I used graphic library TXlib from http://storage.ded32.net.ru/Lib/TX/TXUpdate/Doc/HTML.ru/index.htm
